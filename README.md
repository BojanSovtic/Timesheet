# Timesheet
  Android app for keeping track of your tasks (mainly for timesheet/work purpose). You can create,
edit, and delete your tasks. By long clicking on the task, you start/stop timing it. You can see
all your task in a daily/weekly view from the report option and also delete all tasks up to
(excluding) a given date. The app is created using fragments for dynamically changing view based on
phone orientation and providing different UI for portrait and landscape mode.
  There is an option for generating random timings data for created tasks for debugging purposes.
